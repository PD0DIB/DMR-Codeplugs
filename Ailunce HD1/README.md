In this repo you will find the codeplug I've build for the HD1.
It includes all the Dutch and Belgium DMR repeaters with the most used Talk Groups.
Also included TG91, TG92, some cross-platform talk groups and al JOTA talkgroups (TG907 & TG9071 ~ TG9078).
In this version also included all VHF (2M) and UHF (70cm) Dutch FM repeaters.
